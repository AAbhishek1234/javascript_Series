//VARIABLE
1.variable holds the value 
2.variable like container which is used to store the value 
3.variable are stored in the RAM(Random Access Memory)
4. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaration" a variable

Three ways to declare the variable 
var let and const 
it is also keyword which is predefine in compiler or interpreter
which means we donot add external variable for declartion because it is define in compiler and interpreter

var a =10
now 10 is stored in a. a is like container which is store the value 10.
if you want to see the value theb you have to console.log(a) which is show 10
 now ONE important this is that variable is declaration through special character like $ and _(underscore)
A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign.
now we talk about declaration
var :it is used in traditional not now but it works fine nowdays it is not good practice now days 
var a =10;
var name = "ram"
it is redeclare and ressign the value with same name of variable 
var a=10;
var a=20; it prints 20 because it take last value stored in the variable 
Let (let):
it is also used for variable declaration which  comes in  ECMA script now days  we use the let or const 
let a =10 it prints 10
but it have one thing it is not redeclare with same name but value is allowed for reassign
like let a=10
a=20 
it is show 20 but we cannot redeclare with a because it store in the memory and check(RAM)
Const:const is also known as constant which means not change 
it is not redeclare and not reassign the value but its limitations
only time is declare and assign value 
const a=30;
shows 30 but it cannot update value and not use of the varoable second time


var have globally scope on the other hand let and const have block of scope accessible.
